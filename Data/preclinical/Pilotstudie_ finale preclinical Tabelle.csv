Diabetic mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) at 125?mg/kg dissolved in citrate buffer (20?mM, pH 4.5). Control mice were treated identically except that a similar volume of buffer was injected instead of STZ. Blood samples were taken from the tail 48?h after administration of STZ to confirm the induction of DM. Mice with serum glucose concentrations of ?15?mmol/L were considered as diabetic (as measured with the ACCUCHECK Blood Glucose Monitoring System©, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). All experimental comparisons of diabetic and non-diabetic control mice were made 4 weeks following STZ administration.9
